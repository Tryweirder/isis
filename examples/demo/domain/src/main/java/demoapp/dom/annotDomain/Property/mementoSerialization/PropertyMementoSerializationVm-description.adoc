The `mementoSerialization` element of the `@Property` annotation specifies whether a property should be included in an XML snapshot, as created by the `XmlSnapshotService`:

The `takeSnapshot` mixin action shows how this service is used:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMementoSerializationVm_takeSnapshot.java[tags=class]
----

There are several use cases of the resultant XML; a common one is for adhoc auditing.
Another is when there's a need to pass the state of an object (graph) into a supporting domain service, for example to perform a mail merge.
All that is required is the state of the object, which can then be extracted, eg using XPath.
This allows the domain object and service to have no direct knowledge of each other; the binding is entirely configuration driven.



== Annotations and Meta-annotations

The example view model indicates which properties to include or exclude from the view model:

* with no annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMementoSerializationVm.java[tags=no-annotation]
----
+
These will be included by default.

* explicitly included:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMementoSerializationVm.java[tags=annotated-included]
----

* explicitly excluded:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMementoSerializationVm.java[tags=annotated-excluded]
----

* included through a meta-annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMementoSerializationVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-included]
----
+
where the meta-annotation is:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::MementoSerializationIncludedMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----

* excluded through a meta-annotation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMementoSerializationVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-excluded]
----
+
where the meta-annotation is:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::MementoSerializationExcludedMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----

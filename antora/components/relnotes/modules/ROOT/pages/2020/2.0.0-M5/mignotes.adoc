WARNING: Not released yet.

== Removal of Image Value Type

Some Java classes and/or packages have been renamed/moved:

[source,java]
.Applib
----
// org.apache.isis.applib.value.Image
org.apache.isis.legacy.applib.value.Image // <.>
----
<.> only kept to ease migration, use `java.awt.image.BufferedImage` instead, which is supported by the framework as value type


== Removal of deprecated Contributees

.Config
[source,java]
----
isis.core.metaModel.validator.serviceActionsOnly=true // <.>
isis.core.metaModel.validator.mixins-only=true        // <.>
----
<.> `@DomainService(natureOfService=VIEW/REST)` is now solely used for UI menu action providers and REST end-points.
There is no longer the need to validate uses of `natureOfService=DOMAIN` as this option was removed.
<.> Support for services that contribute members to other `DomainObjects` was removed. Use `Mixins` instead.

See the former java-doc for hints on how to migrate the previous options.

.@DomainService(natureOfService=...)
[source,java]
----
/**
 * A <em>programmatic</em> service.
 * <p>
 * The service's actions do not appear on any viewer and are not visible in the REST API. In other words
 * these are not contributed to the domain-model. However, the service is injectable into domain objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release! use Spring's {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Service @Service} instead;
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #REST}
 */
@Deprecated
DOMAIN,

/**
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release! use {@link #REST} instead;
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #REST}
 */
@Deprecated
VIEW_REST_ONLY,

/**
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release! use {@link #VIEW} instead
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #VIEW}
 */
@Deprecated
VIEW_MENU_ONLY,

/**
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release!
 * <p>
 * For now, contributing actions will be gathered to show up in the 'others' menu to ease migration.
 * These will likely not work.
 * <p>
 * Migration Note: For each {@code Action} write a new mixin class.
 * see {@link Mixin}
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #VIEW}
 */
@Deprecated

== Changes to the Programming Model

=== Removed (Programming Model)

[cols="2a,3a", options="header"]

|===

| was
| now what?

| `@ActionLayout(contributed=...)`
| was only effective on mixin methods; use `@Action`, `@Property` or `@Collection` instead

| `@Action/@Property(command=...)`
| replaced with `commandPublishing`

| `@Action/@Property(publish=...)`
| replaced with `executionPublishing`

| `@DomainObject(audit=...)`
| replaced with `entityChangePublishing`

| `@DomainObject(nature=...)`

* `EXTERNAL_ENTITY`
* `INMEMORY_ENTITY`
| use `@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)` instead

| `@DomainObject(publish=...)`
| replaced with `entityChangePublishing`

| `@DomainService(repositoryFor=...)`
| if this domain service acts as a repository for an entity type,
specify that entity type (was never implemented)

| `@Mixin`
| use `@Action`, `@Property` or `@Collection` instead;

for more fine grained control (eg. setting the mixin's method name)
use `@DomainObject(nature=MIXIN, ...)` combined with one of the above

| `@ViewModel`
| use `@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)` instead

| `@ViewModelLayout`
| use `@DomainObjectLayout` instead

|===


=== Added (Programming Model)

.Command/Execution Publishing (Member Level Annotations)
[source,java]
----
@Action/@Property(commandPublishing=ENABLED/DISABLED)   // <.>
@Action/@Property(executionPublishing=ENABLED/DISABLED) // <.>
----
<.> affects Command publishing
<.> affects Execution publishing

.Entity Change Publishing (Class Level Annotations)
[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(entityChangePublishing=ENABLED/DISABLED) // <.>
----
<.> affects EntityChange publishing (effective only for entity types)

=== Renamed (Programming Model)

.Publishing API/SPI
[source,java]
----
AuditerService -> EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber                  // <.>
PublisherService -> ExecutionSubscriber & EntityChangesSubscriber // <.>
CommandServiceListener -> CommandSubscriber

PublishedObjects -> ChangingEntities
----
<.> `EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber` receives pre-post property values for each changed entity
<.> `EntityChangesSubscriber` receives the entire set of changed entities, serializable as `ChangesDto`


.Loggers - each to be activated by enabling debug logging for the corresponding Logger class
[source,java]
----
AuditerServiceLogging -> EntityPropertyChangeLogger
PublisherServiceLogging -> ExecutionLogger & EntityChangesLogger
CommandLogger (NEW)
----

.Internal Services
[source,java]
----
AuditerDispatchService -> EntityPropertyChangePublisher
PublisherDispatchService -> ExecutionPublisher & EntityChangesPublisher
PublisherDispatchServiceDefault -> ExecutionPublisherDefault & EntityChangesPublisherDefault
CommandServiceInternal -> CommandPublisher
----

== Changes to Applib and Services

[cols="3m,3m", options="header"]

|===

| was
| new

| AuthenticationSession
| Authentication (no longer holds MessageBroker or session attributes, is now immutable)

| AuthenticationSessionStrategy
| AuthenticationStrategy

| AuthenticationSessionStrategyBasicAuth (*1*)
| AuthenticationStrategyBasicAuth

| AuthenticationSessionStrategyDefault (*1*)
| AuthenticationStrategyDefault

| AuthenticationSessionTracker#getInteraction : Interaction
| AuthenticationContext#currentInteraction : *Optional*<Interaction>

| Clock (moved from applib module to fixture-applib module)
| VirtualClock (introduced)

| IsisInteractionFactory
| InteractionFactory

| InteractionClosure
| AuthenticationLayer

| IsisInteractionTracker
| InteractionTracker

| MessageBroker is held by Authentication(Session)
| MessageBroker is held by InteractionSession

| QueryDefault removed
|
[line-through]#new QueryDefault<>(CommandJdo.class, "findByParent",
                        "parent", parent));#

Query.named(CommandJdo.class, "findByParent") +
    .withParameter("parent", parent));

| TestClock (removed)
| use factories of VirtualClock.frozenTestClock() instead

| UserService#getUser() : UserMemento
| UserService#currentUser() : *Optional*<UserMemento>

| SudoService
| redefined, see java doc for details

|===

<1> These might be in use with configuration files, check yours!

== Deprecations

.RepositoryService
[source,java]
----
<T> T detachedEntity(Class<T> ofType);     // <.>
----
<.> if applicable use `<T> T detachedEntity(T entity)` instead ... "new is the new new", passing
in a new-ed up (entity) instance is more flexible and also more error prone, eg. it allows the compiler to check
validity of the used constructor rather than doing construction reflective at runtime

CAUTION: TODO: v2 - command annotations are out-of-date

The `@Property` annotation applies to properties collecting together all domain semantics within a single annotation.

It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as contributed properties.

----
<.> `commandDtoProcessor()`
+
If the xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay] extension is being used (for regression testing), provides a mechanism to process the `CommandDto` before being replicated from primary to secondary system

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#commandPublishing[`commandPublishing()`]
+
Whether the editing of a property should be published to registered xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandSubscriber.adoc[`CommandSubscriber`]s as a `Command` object, that captures the details of this edit. Typically so it can be logged using the xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] extension (for auditing or for regression testing using xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay]).

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#domainEvent[`domainEvent()`]
+
The event type to be posted to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] to broadcast the property's business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its modification (before and after).

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#editing[`editing()`]
+
Whether a property can be modified or cleared from within the UI

<.> `editingDisabledReason()`
+
The reason that this property cannot be modified.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#executionPublishing[`executionPublishing()`]
+
Whether the editing of a property should be published to registered xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`ExecutionSubscriber`]s as an `Execution` object, that captures the details of this edit.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#fileAccept[`fileAccept()`]
+
Hints the file type (media type or file extension) to be uploaded to a xref:applib-classes:value-types.adoc#Blob[`Blob`]
 or xref:applib-classes:value-types.adoc#Clob[`Clob`]. +
+
Note that this does not prevent the user from uploading some other file type; rather it merely defaults the file type in the file open dialog.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#hidden[`hidden()`]
+
Indicates where (in the UI) the property should be hidden from the user.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#maxLength[`maxLength()`]
+
Maximum number of characters for string parameters; ignored otherwise +
+
TIP: In many/most cases you should however use xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc[`@Column#length()`]

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#snapshot[`snapshot()`]
+
Whether to exclude from snapshots. +

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#mustSatisfy[`mustSatisfy()`]
+
Implementation of `o.a.i.applib.spec.Specification` that allows arbitrary validation to be applied.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#optionality[`optionality()`]
+
Specifies a property is optional rather than mandatory
+
TIP: In many/most cases you should however use xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc[`@Column#allowsNull()`]

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#projecting[`projecting()`]
+
Indicates that owning object is a view model that is acting as a projection of the underlying entity referenced by this property.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#regexPattern[`regexPattern()`]
+
Validates the contents of a string parameter against the regular expression pattern

<.> `regexPatternFlags()`
+
Value of flags as normally passed to `java.util.regex.` +
`Pattern#compile(...)`, modifying the compilation of the regular expression

<.> `regexPatternReplacement()`
+
Unused.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class Customer {
    public static class EmailSpecification extends AbstractSpecification<String> {
        public String satisfiesSafely(String proposed) {
            return EmailUtil.ensureValidEmail(proposed);    // <1>
        }
    }
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true")                // <2>
    @Property(
        maxLength=30,
        mustSatisfy=EmailSpecification.class,
        regexPattern = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+",
        regexPatternFlags=Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
    )
    public String getEmailAddress() { /* ... */ }
    public void setEmailAddress(String emailAddress) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> the (fictitious) `EmailUtil.ensureValid(...)` (omitted for brevity) returns a string explaining if an email is invalid
<2> generally use instead of the `@Property#optionality` attribute





[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.  This is specifically
so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
